# 571a: SLR, MLR, confidence intervals (new/existing obs), confidence bands (Working-Hotelling procedure) for SLR/MLR, (LINE) assumptions, remedial measures to (LINE) violations, nonlinear transformations on predictors/response (poly(), boxcox(), log()), interactions terms, regularization with LASSO/Ridge using glmnet, family-wise inference, Full v. Reduced models, logistic regression, ggplot (plotting all of the above in session 13), splines, missing data (mice package)
